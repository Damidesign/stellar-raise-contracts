# 🚀 Stellar Raise Contracts

![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/Mac-5/stellar-raise-contracts/branch/develop/graph/badge.svg)

A **crowdfunding smart contract** built on the [Stellar](https://stellar.org/) network using [Soroban](https://soroban.stellar.org/).

## Overview

Stellar Raise lets anyone create a crowdfunding campaign on-chain. Contributors pledge tokens toward a goal before a deadline. If the goal is met, the creator withdraws the funds. If not, contributors are refunded automatically.

### Key Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Initialize** | Create a campaign with a goal, deadline, and token |
| **Contribute** | Pledge tokens before the deadline |
| **Withdraw** | Creator claims funds after a successful campaign |
| **Refund** | Contributors reclaim tokens if the goal is missed |

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (stable)
- The `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target:

  ```bash
  rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
  ```

- [Stellar CLI](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/getting-started/setup) (optional, for deployment)

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/stellar-raise-contracts.git
cd stellar-raise-contracts

# Build the contract
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Run tests
cargo test --workspace
```

## Contract Interface

```rust
// Create a new campaign
fn initialize(env, creator, token, goal, deadline);

// Pledge tokens to the campaign
fn contribute(env, contributor, amount);

// Creator withdraws after successful campaign
fn withdraw(env);

// Refund all contributors if goal not met
fn refund(env);

// View functions
fn total_raised(env) -> i128;
fn goal(env) -> i128;
fn deadline(env) -> u64;
fn contribution(env, contributor) -> i128;
```

## Upgrading the Contract

Once deployed, the contract can be upgraded to a new WASM implementation without changing its address or losing stored data. This allows the project to ship fixes and improvements without redeploying.

### Upgrade Procedure

1. **Build the new WASM binary:**
   ```bash
   cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
   ```

2. **Upload the new WASM to the network:**
   ```bash
   stellar contract install \
     --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/crowdfund.wasm \
     --network testnet \
     --source <YOUR_SECRET_KEY>
   ```
   This returns the WASM hash (SHA-256).

3. **Invoke the upgrade function:**
   ```bash
   stellar contract invoke \
     --id <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> \
     --fn upgrade \
     --arg <WASM_HASH> \
     --network testnet \
     --source <YOUR_SECRET_KEY>
   ```

### Important Notes

- Only the **admin** (set to the campaign creator at initialization) can call the upgrade function.
- The upgrade is **irreversible** — ensure the new WASM is thoroughly tested before upgrading.
- All contract storage and state persist across upgrades.
- The contract address remains the same after an upgrade.
- **Recommendation:** Have at least two reviewers approve upgrade PRs before merging to production.

## Deployment (Testnet)

```bash
# Build the optimized WASM
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Deploy using Stellar CLI
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/crowdfund.wasm \
  --network testnet \
  --source <YOUR_SECRET_KEY>
```
